In this lecture we have covered the topic of loops:
Loops are used to perform the same operation multiple times.
We have discussed how loops work.
We have discussed types of loops
The different types of loops are:-
	a) while loop
  b) for loop
	c) do while loop
We have discussed how each loop works.
We have also learned the meaning of initialisation i.e. what is happening at the beginning of the loop.This happens in loop that has not started yet.
Also, this incomlete code was done: 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int i;
	for(i=0;){
		cout<<i<<" ";
	}
}
