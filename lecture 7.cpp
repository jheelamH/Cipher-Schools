In this lecture we have learned about arrays and it's significance. How it differs from an integer input.
Also we have done the following code:  
int main()
{
int a,b,c,d,e;
cout<<"Give 5 integers as input"<<endl;
cin>>a>>b>>c>>d>>e;
cout<<"The integers in reverse order are: "<<a<<b<<c<<d<<e;
return e;
}
